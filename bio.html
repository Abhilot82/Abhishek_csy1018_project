                    <p>I was born and raised in India. I obtained my high school and Intermediate in different schools. In 2013 I completed my high school and In 2015 I completed my Intermediate. Upon completion of my school, I went to the UK for studying.</p>

                    <p>In high school and intermediate, My activities were many. I participated as an army shoulder for the national anthem show organized by the school. Outside of the school I also participated in a state level cricket matches. In 2014 I have also worked as a volunteer for national health camp society.</p>
